# UnsavouryAutoSave1.1
Micro-App for Windows that provides external auto-save functionality to other apps. UnsavouryAutoSave allows the user to specify an application (such as a text editor). While that application is running and focused (window in front) Ctrl-S input is simulated at user-defined intervals, essentially creating auto-save functionality for application that do not natively support such functionality (e.g. specialized editors for particular scripting languages). Assumes that Ctrl-S is indeed the "save" keyboard shortcut.

Note: _Windows may flag this app as dangerous_ or possibly containing a virus. It clearly does not. However, Windows may notice that this app scans other window processes (to verify if the chosen one is running) and simulates input, both of which are factors it may deem as suspect. When prompted, manually confirm that you know what you're doing and/or that would like to run this app (option may be hidden under "show more" or similar when the warning appears.

Currently only supports Windows 11.
